# Contributing

I'm happy to accept pull requests to this repo that contain bug fixes, code cleanup, refactoring, or general improvements to the existing code base. If you want to add new services, I suggest you fork the repo. This repo is meant to be a template for you, not a megalithic repo that has components for every service under the sun.

If you have a suggestion on a way to abstract the API and UI components so they can be shared, please let me know! As I was developing it, I realized I was making a lot of very opinionated decisions regarding how data is fetched and rendered. In an effort to get this out the door and share it, I decided it would be best if people just forked it.
